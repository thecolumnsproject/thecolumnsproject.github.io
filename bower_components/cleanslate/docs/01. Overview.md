&#8202;<span class="project-name">Cleanslate</span> is an extreme CSS reset stylesheet. It is used to reset the styling of an HTML element and all its children, back to default CSS values. It is composed exclusively of [!important](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#important-rules) rules, which override all other types of rules.

It does not require any JavaScript – it’s just a CSS stylesheet. However, you may find it useful when used within JavaScript widgets, such as those created by the [‘Sqwidget’](:https://github.com/premasagar/sqwidget) library. If you are using JavaScript, then see the section “Manipulating !important styles with JavaScript” below and check out the [‘Important’ jQuery plugin](https://github.com/premasagar/important).

If you have any feedback or questions, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/premasagar/cleanslate/issues) or tell [@premasagar](http://twitter.com/premasagar). Feel free to fork and improve the code.
